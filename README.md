# credit-card-activation
 A simple webpage to allow their customers to activate their credit card.
## About 
 I built this app for a take home interview challenge for the company connex. You can vist the site to try it out yourself here. You can also download the docker image here if you want a running instance of the app to deploy in a swarm. ðŸ˜Ž

 I focused more on functionality and scalability with this app than on styling as the position is for a backend one. The app is written in JS, I could add to this app by writing it on typescript to preserve type safety or I could do have made it with gin on golang.
